# Giftflow allows flexible layouts with Gutenberg (Archive + Detail pages)

Giftflow is designed to work with **Gutenberg**, so you can customize layouts without writing code—especially for the two most important parts of your donation website:

- **Archive page**: where visitors browse campaigns (campaign list/grid)
- **Detail page**: where visitors learn about one campaign and donate

## What you can customize

### Campaign archive page (list of campaigns)

Use Gutenberg to control how your campaign listing feels:

- **Headline and intro** (set context and trust)
- **Layout** (grid vs list, spacing, columns)
- **Filters/sections** (featured campaigns first, then all campaigns)
- **Visuals** (images, badges like “Active”, “Completed”)
- **Call-to-action** (encourage visitors to open a campaign)

### Campaign detail page (single campaign)

This is where conversion happens. Gutenberg lets you control:

- **Hero section** (title + image + short summary)
- **Progress / goal** placement
- **Donation form placement** (above the fold or after story)
- **Gallery** (photos / impact)
- **Updates / FAQ** sections

## Keep it simple (and explore)

If you’re just getting started, focus on the basics and iterate:

- **Archive page**: make it easy to choose a campaign in 5 seconds
- **Detail page**: make it easy to donate in 30 seconds

You don’t need a “perfect” layout on day one—use Gutenberg to move sections around, try different blocks, and see what feels best for your audience.
