# Apple Pay & Google Pay Support Coming to Giftflow Pro

We're thrilled to announce that **Giftflow Pro** will include support for **Apple Pay** and **Google Pay**, bringing modern, one-tap donation experiences to your fundraising campaigns. This is one of the most requested features from our community, and we can't wait to share it with you soon.

## Why Digital Wallets Matter

In today's fast-paced world, donors want to give quickly and securely. Digital wallets like Apple Pay and Google Pay remove friction from the donation process, making it easier than ever for supporters to contribute to causes they care about.

### The Power of One-Tap Donations

**Traditional Checkout:**
- Fill out donation form
- Enter card number (16 digits)
- Type expiration date
- Enter CVV code
- Add billing address
- Click donate
- Wait for processing

**With Apple Pay or Google Pay:**
- Fill out donation form
- Tap Apple Pay or Google Pay button
- Authenticate with Face ID, Touch ID, or PIN
- Done! ✨

That's it. What used to take 45-60 seconds now happens in under 10 seconds.

## What This Means for Your Organization

### Higher Conversion Rates

Digital wallet payments have been shown to significantly increase donation completion rates:

- **Faster Checkout** - Donors complete their contribution before changing their mind
